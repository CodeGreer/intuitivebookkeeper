                    <p>"When our church needed someone to handle our 501c3, I could have trusted no better person than Kim Fodrie. She did an incredible job in helping us achieve our non-profit status. She did so well, that we asked her to keep the books every year since then, for the last 8 years. She was so helpful in answering all of our questions, and I felt confident in her abilities to help us.</p>

                    <p>Kim is knowledgeable in all the critical areas for helping businesses with their corporate taxes and filings. You won’t find anyone else that can help you quite like she does. Her professionalism, integrity, and personal touch help her rise to the very top. Know that in choosing her, you can rest assured that whatever job you have for her will be well taken care so you can sit back and relax.</p>

                    <p>We will continue to use her, and in so doing, highly recommend her to all others."</p>
