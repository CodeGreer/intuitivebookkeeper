                <p>My name is Kim Fodrie, and I am the founder of The Intuitive Bookkeeper.</p>

                <p>I like to think of myself as more of a profit partner working with small business owners to plan strategies for financial freedom and security.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Why Intuitive?</span> I’m not your everyday bookkeeper.  Most accounting majors are left brain processors.  I am 50/50, using my creative right-brain to look into areas that are in the grey in addition to using my left-brain for detail and analytics.</p>

                <p>I am a wife, mother, Mimi, and homeschool mom.  I love spending time with my family, traveling, reading, self-development, organization, a good movie, a Netflix binge, and of course, number crunching.  I absolutely love, love, love to laugh! I love working with non-profits, especially behind the scenes.  Serving others and giving back is a part of who I am.</p>

                <p>I look forward to connecting and working with you!</p><br>
