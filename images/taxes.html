                <h3>Taxes</h3>
                
                <p>Many businessowners dread tax time because of the additional paperwork burden, confusing tax forms, and compliance uncertainty. I only prepare tax returns for my bookkeeping clients, so they receive the professionalism and individual attention they deserve.</p>
                
                <p>When tax time comes around, your books are already in order, and we’ve already strategized to ensure you receive every credit and deduction you’re entitled to. Completing and filing your tax returns will be as simple and stress-free as possible, especially for you. And the cost will already be bundled into your monthly bookkeeping fee.</p>

                    <p>"Kim really saved my bacon. I incorporated my business at the end of the year and didn't realize that I'd need help filing my corporate taxes until mid-March. I contacted Kim on March 14th, and she managed to get my extension filed on the March 15th deadline. She was professional and responsive throughout the process of getting my tax returns prepared and had the forms to me in time for me to include them with my personal income taxes. Kim is both knowledgeable and easy to work with, and I particularly recommend her for business and corporate tax filings. I'll be relying on her for planning and compliance moving forward."</p>
